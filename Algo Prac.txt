1) Write an algorithm to print Pascal Triangle
   
    1)Take a number of rows to be printed, assume it to be n

    2)Make outer iteration i from 0 to n times to print the rows.
        a) Make inner iteration for j from 0 to (N – 1).
            Print single blank space ” “
            Close inner loop (j loop) //it’s needed for left spacing
        b) Make inner iteration for j from 0 to i.
             Print nCr of i and j(factorial(i)/(factorial(i - j)*factorial(j)));
             Close inner loop.
        c)Print newline character (\n) after each inner iteration.




2) Write an Algorithm to check HCF of 3 number (Highest Common Factor)
      
    1)Declare Variable as num1,num2,num3.
    
    2)Accept valur from keyboard and assign to num1,num2,num3.
    
    3)assig a variable min to store the minimum of three numbers(Math.min(num1,Math.min(num2,num3))).
    
    4)Assing count value to min(count =min)
    
    5)Repeat until count>=1:
       a) is i divides num1, num2, num3 completely
          Print 'HCF is',i
          terminate loop.
       b)decrement count by 1(Count--)

    6)is count<1
        Print'HCF not available'

         
   


3) Write an Algorithm to Print Fibonacci Series

   1)Declare variable as n.
    
   2)Accept valur from keyboard and assign to n.

   3)assign two values a as 0 and b as 1 as the first two number of the series(a=0,b=1)
  
   4)Print(a,b)

   5)Assign count value to 1(count=1)

   6)Repeat until count<=n
      a)assign sum as a+b(sum=a+b)
         Print sum.
      b)Swap them(a=b,b=sum)
      c)increment count by 1(count++)









4) Write an Algorithm to Check the string is palindrome or not

   1) Declare a string as str
   2) Accept valur from keyboard and assign to str
   3) Assign length and Calculate the length of the string(length=str.length())
   4) Initialize rev = “ ”   [empty string]
   5) Asign count to length - 1 
   6) Repeat until count>=0:
		6.1: rev = rev + Character at position ‘count’ of the string
		6.2: decrement count by 1(count--)
   7) If string = rev:
		7.1: Print “Given string is palindrome”
   8) Else:
		8.1: Print “Given string is not palindrome” 




5) Write an Algorithm to Print prime numbers of given range 


  1)Declare variables as num1,num2.
  
  2)Accept value from keyboard ad assign to num1,num2.

  3)initialize a flag variable as 0(f=0).

  4)Assign i to num1.

  6)Repeat until i>=num2.
     a)assign j to 1

     b)repeat until j<=i:
        i)is i mod j=0
            flag++
        ii)is flag=2
             print j
        iii)increment j by 1
     c)increment i by 1
